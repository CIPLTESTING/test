5:32 PM Customer: and they have default deny policy
5:32 PM Customer: No its opening, which should not be
5:33 PM Shalu Yadav: Need to block it 
5:33 PM Customer: It should be blocked by default instead of specifiing it
5:33 PM Customer: as template is default deny
5:34 PM Shalu Yadav: We recommend to use Allow All template rather then using Deny all template.
5:34 PM Shalu Yadav: With Allow All it works fine.
5:35 PM Shalu Yadav: In that you can deny wheatever you want to block 
5:35 PM Customer: Yes that i know but then whats the purpose of having default deny policy
5:35 PM Customer: and in allow all template i have to choose all and define allow or deny
5:35 PM Customer: which is very painfull process
5:36 PM Customer: i wanted to allow only sepecific categories which they needs to and deny rest all
